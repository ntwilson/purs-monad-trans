# purs-monad-trans
Derive the ExceptT monad transformer in PureScript (with hints for F# programmers)

This repo is intended for a lunch-n-learn series in Feb 2021.  It will contain the finished result, but the presentation contains much of the explanations of what's going on, so just reading the code is likely not sufficient to get a good idea of how monad transformers work.
